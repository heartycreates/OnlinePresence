          The anticipation and tension is first built up through exploring alone in a dark cave. Later on user found his friends throughout his adventure and that is where the user was able to feel their physical presence and feel connected with them throughout the process.<br>
          <br>
          Throughout the journey, the user has to explore three different themed caves and is stimulated and entertained by multiple tasks such as finding items, defeating villains and identifying animal sounds as he reaches the goal. The experience feels like a challenge to him in the way that the user must first complete a mini mission to find the tool, such as a sword or a key to unlock the next stage.
         By exploring different caves, the user can feel like he is progressing through the game and by collecting different items and achievements, the user can also feel motivated through rewards.
						
          The overall gift giving experience is adventurous to our user in the way that it narrates a story of exploring a cave, which is an unknown and mysterious territory. <br>
          <br> It is rewarding in the way that it allows the user to collect different items as he makes progress, which fits with the user's interests and preferences. It is funny and makes the user feel connected to his friends in the way that the user gets to see his friends dressed up in dramatic costumes in his favorite games in each cave scene just for his birthday. It is challenging in the way that the user has to complete multiple mini missions in order to unlock the next one, which emulates his normal gaming environment and activates the user to take actions.

        <div class="service-name-text">#1 The Research & Iteration Process</div>
        <br>
        <div class="paragraph-light">We used questionnaires as our first technique. Questionnaires are straightforward, do not have time constraints and allow us to cover the various aspects of the topic of gift receiving. This will help us familiarize the designer with an overview of the user's general character, perception and experience with the topic. As participants answer these short, creative questions one by one, it will help recall their memories and emotions related to gift receiving. Such a process will help participants to feel mentally prepared for the topic of our research. We will create a questionnaire with 10 open ended questions. 5 questions are related to our users gift receiving experiences and preferences, while another 5 gives us more insights on the users’ personal relationships and interests. <br>
          <br>
          We will gather the data at the beginning of our research in week 11. We will send the questionnaire to the participant and let them fill out the answers individually and then talk about the outcome. The data will be documented in a template. This template can be found in the appendix A.<br>
          <br>
          For the second meeting we choose to use the personal inventory. For this activity we ask our user’s before the meeting to take photos of 10-15 objects, which play an important role in their lives. These objects can either be physical or digital products. Each user will bring the photos to the second meeting, where we will talk about the meaning of each object. We will look at one object at a time and ask questions to each object to gain insight into the user’s habits, relationships with digital and physical products and their lifestyle. Searching and choosing the objects should inspire the user to think about why an object is important to him and recall memories about, when he received it and who gave it to him. The questions will be prepared in a template which we will follow and fill out after the meeting. This template can be found in the appendix A. This conversation will be audio recorded, so that we can focus on the activity.<br>
          <br>
          The third technique we will be using is Draw the experience. Using this technique, participants will actively engage in the research process. Since drawing is not limited by text or expression, participants will be able to visualize ideas that might usually be difficult to articulate in words or text. The time limit for drawing also encourages participants to think quickly, intuitively with little time for judgement, so we believe that such technique will help us gather raw and honest data of participant’s thought process and ideas. This will help us find out what our participants values, preferences and emotions in regards to a gift receiving experience. In week 12 We will schedule a meeting with our participants at the school cafeteria. We will bring several pens and 1 blank A3 paper artbook for the participants to draw his gift giving experience. They will have 10 minutes to draw the idea and they can choose to extend the time if they want to. By the end of the session, we will ask them follow up questions based on the drawing.<br>
          <br>
                      
          After we have already gained some data with the previous research techniques, we will do a scenario testing. We will create cards with 10-20 different scenarios related to gift giving and gift receiving that include a photo and a short description. This activity was also video recorded to collect the participants' reaction of each scenario. <br>

      <div class="service-name-text">Insight Gathered</div>
      <br>
      <div class="paragraph-light">For insight 1, I learnt that my user is a curious person who likes to immerse himself in large scaled fantasy narratives of games, movies and novels, where one can discover many details and explore the unknown in it. <br><br>
        For insight 2, when it comes to gift receiving, he values excitement and surprises that demonstrate knowledge about his personal interests, preferences and needs. This also applies when it comes to gift giving. I also know that Jurassic Park is one of his all time favourite movies. To combine both insights and apply this to my 'surprise', I created a miniature Jurassic Park with details like ponds, trees, grasses and flowers using a large pillowcase paper box, color papers to replicate a fantasy scenario. I also marked locations that look like a map hinting where the gift, a chocolate egg could possibly locate to stimulate his curiosity. This is because it fits into his personal interests which will help him further immerse and engage with the unwrapping process.<br><br>

        For insight 3, my user likes challenges that allows him to work his way up and achieve personal growth and a sense of competence. To test out the best way to achieve such a purpose in a fun way, in the surprise I combined his interests, the Jurassic Park movie with his love for challenges to create a simple quiz challenge with 5 questions. I also set a rule that for every single question he answered, he will be able to remove one dinosaur from the park, moving himself one step closer to the revealing of the gift.<br><br>
        For insight 4, he wants to feel a sense of importance, to be valued and connected with his community, in the way that people notice and show appreciation towards him as a person. In the surprise I asked him questions from the quizzes with the presence of a few classmates to help him with the questions if he faces difficulties as a collective, making the quiz feels like a teamwork.<br><br>
        In terms of gift giving, I have learnt that providing short speeches before presenting the gift signifies how special the event is. Slowly revealing the gift wrapping also helps to build anticipation for the unwrapping process. I have learnt that instructions have to be clear when it comes to a gift unwrapping process so that users will not feel stuck or lose their motivation.<br><br>
In terms of gift receiving, I have learnt that it is a joyful experience to receive gifts that are customized in accordance to one's preferences and interests. It also makes the receiver feel heartwarming when he or she is able to notice that the gift giver has taken the time and effort to understand your needs. It is also fun when a giver can describe the principles behind his/her decisions and the making process afterwards, which makes the gift feel even more meaningful.<br><br>
In terms of my user, I Learnt that he enjoys quiz challenges and the idea of incorporating his favourite fantasy stories into the gifts. However, since he got a little lost with the lack of instructions and tools when it comes to the gift revealing process, I think the user prefers a clearer instruction of the gift unwrapping process.<br><br>
My user is a curious, social , family oriented person who values authentic communications. <br>
<br>		Based on insight 1, he likes to be immersed in large-scaled fantasies in forms of games, novels and movies. Based on insight 3, He needs to feel a sense of competence through overcoming challenges. Based on insight 2 and 4, he wants to feel a sense of relatedness and importance within his community. Based on insight 7, he wants to create special memories created with family and friends that he can look back on in life.<br><br>
For digital unwrapping, the experience I want my user to have is for him to be further engaged into the fantasy narrative and solve different forms of challenges throughout the process, this will make him feel competent and strengthen his sense of connection with the community. To sum up the digital unwrapping process, Floris, a curious, social person who values authenticity needs a way to feel adventurous through the unwrapping experience because he likes challenges that allows him to work his way up to achieve personal growth and gain a sense of competence.<br><br>
The overall gift giving experience I want Floris to have is adventurous, challenging, meaningful in the sense that it enables him to feel the connection with his community. For the token, I want him to experience the full immersion in a cohesive and smooth narration, so as to gradually build up his anticipation for the unwrapping process. The token will work as the entrance, an introduction to the unwrapping process and the actual gift itself. <br>
          <br>		While the unwrapping process will present challenges and a sense of competence as he completes tasks along the process. I want the two processes to work together to create a cohesive narrative that builds up users' anticipation and motivation, allowing my user to feel adventurous as he discovers many details and surprises during the process.<br><br>
          <br>		For this experience and the user, activation means enabling exploration, conveying excitement, and teasing. aesthetics means taste, recognizable, consistency and quality of the design. Narrative means showing the user a relatable dramatic arc with clear comprehension, composition and cause-and-effect connections that is coherent and holistic.. <br>
          <br>		Immersion means creating a personally relevant fantasy story that has a clear goal for the user to focus on the experience by triggering the user's senses, it also invites exploration and activation of the user to give him a sense of control. It also means adding playful features that stimulate user's cognitive stimulation. Meaning factor wise, ​Pleasure/Stimulation, means that user will engage in new sensation and activities, Security/Control means that user will have the ability to exercise his own autonomy to make decisions and influence the outcome Competence/Effectiveness means that users experience growth and learning throughout the process, Relatedness means that user feels a sense of connection within his community.

        <div class="service-name-text">Iteration Process</div>
        <br>
        <div class="paragraph-light">I applied 2 creative techniques. The first one is "swapping sketches". The technique requires multiple people to form a group in a 20 minutes session, while each person will first have 5 minutes to sketch an original idea based on the HMW questions. Then, each person will swap their idea with the person next to them, and that person will have 5 minutes to add new sketches that build up or improve the idea further. As a result, by the end of the session the group will have multiple developed ideas.<br>
          <br>		
          In a group, there are many members of different genders, nationalities and experiences, and they have very different ways to approach the same HMW question. By setting a time limit, the technique allows everyone to visualize their idea in a clear and free way before the ideas are flooded by too much doubt and overthinking. <br>
          <br>		Through quick sketching, it also helps each person to express their ideas in a more direct and concrete way. This avoids misunderstandings or misinterpretation on the result or composition of the idea. For example, when a person sketches a game map, other members will quickly understand the composition and look of the map, there is a lower chance of misunderstanding. My members were able to create surprising ideas such as zombie shooting, traveling on a boat to find one's way home, t-shirts that channel presence and memories of my users' friends, which are all surprising ideas that I never thought of.<br>
          <br>		
          The second technique is "swapping notes". The technique requires multiple people to form an online group in a 20 minutes session on Miroboard. There are 5 rounds to this session. In each round each person will first have 5 minutes to write an original idea based on the HMW questions. Then, each person will swap their idea with the person next to them, and that person will have 5 minutes to add new notes below the original idea that build up or improve the idea further.<br>
          <br>		 As a result, by the end of the session the group will have multiple developed ideas. The technique helps us come up with surprising new ideas in the way that it is not limited by graphics, so each person can build on the idea in the way they visualise it. At some point the ideas become very spontaneous and groovy because we want to surprise the next one who builds the idea after us. For example, a user went into a drunk cave musical festival and had to avoid getting drunk or being beaten up, aka, to be able to survive until the morning. He/she will also have to defeat a monster throughout the journey. This idea was very funny and fits with our persona who loves EDM music, wildlife and challenges, which me and my partner later adopted into our prototype.

      <div class="service-name-text">Final Concept</div>
      <br>
      <div class="paragraph-light">User will be told that his friends are preparing something special for his birthday. Inside the lantern there is a QR code that user will scan to access the gift unwrapping experience. In the experience he will meet his friends who are busy preparing the event, leaving him to explore the caves to find them. He will begin to explore an unknown cave with 3 caves in it. <br>
        <br>		The first cave is an Age of Empire themed party room where he will have to find a sword, the second cave is a World of Warcraft party room where he will defeat a villain from the game, and the last cave is a wildlife themed party room where his friend is DJing EDM music with different wildlife animals. When all items are collected and challenges are completed, a gift will be unlocked with his friends being present in the game. <br>
        <br>		
        When the gift is opened there is a message from the friends wishing him a happy birthday.
        We chose this final concept because its content is the most dynamic and captures the many areas of interests of the user: EDM music, Wildlife animals, Strategic computer games World of Warcraft and Age of Empire, while still being a cohesive adventure story. <br>
        <br>		It also takes into consideration the user's need to feel connected to his friends throughout his exploration journey and motivates him to feel competent by completing different missions. The dramatic arc is improved by adding a gift revealing process, asking the user to make a guess of the final gift to build up anticipation of the gift opening process. <br>

        <br>
        <div class="paragraph-light">
          We started to discuss the final prototype, when both of us had decided on our personal “final” prototype. By presenting and testing each other’s prototypes we pointed out what we liked about each other’s prototypes. <br>
          <br>		We considered the flow, the narrative, the aesthetics and the dramatic arc when looking at each other’s prototypes. In regards of the aesthetics, both of us really liked the style of the pixel art, so we quickly decided that this will be the style we will go with. We used the backgrounds and artworks from Heidi’s prototype and transformed them into pixel art using an app.<br>
          <br>		
          To make the experience feel more like a game, we decided to make the beginning of the experience similar to Heidi’s prototype, where Filip has a monologue, introducing himself to the experience and explaining what is happening.<br>

      <div class="service-name-text">Reflection</div>
      <br>
      <div class="paragraph-light">
        For digital unwrapping, we want Filip to feel like he is on an adventure to completing a quest. The anticipation and tension is first built up through exploring alone in a dark cave. Later on he found his friends throughout his adventure and that is where the user was able to feel their physical presence and feel connected with them throughout the process. Throughout the journey, the user has to explore three different themed caves and is stimulated and entertained by multiple tasks such as finding items, defeating villains and identifying animal sounds as he reaches the goal. The experience feels like a challenge to him in the way that the user must first complete a mini mission to find the tool, such as a sword or a key to unlock the next stage. <br>
        <br>		By exploring different caves, the user can feel like he is progressing through the game and by collecting different items and achievements, the user can also feel motivated through rewards.
        The overall gift giving experience is adventurous to our user in the way that it narrates a story of exploring a cave, which is an unknown and mysterious territory. <br>
        <br>		It is rewarding in the way that it allows the user to collect different items as he makes progress, which fits with the user's interests and preferences. It is funny and makes the user feel connected to his friends in the way that the user gets to see his friends dressed up in dramatic costumes in his favourite games in each cave scene just for his birthday. It is challenging in the way that the user has to complete multiple mini missions in order to unlock the next one, which emulates his normal gaming environment and activates the user to take actions.
        <br>
          <br>		We believe that for the overall experience our prototypes are fulfilling our design vision. However, what we would like to change about our final prototype is to add more sound effects to stimulate the senses of the user. For example, we would like to add some dramatic music to the scenes where the user found the targeted item. It emphasizes the special scene just like a traditional computer game and helps the user feel competent as he completes the mission. We would also like to add environmental sounds such as the inside of a cave and the jungle to make the experience even more immerse and convincing for our user.
